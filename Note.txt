So far we have learned how to work with RabbitMQ and Spring Boot and send messages via RabbitTemplate.
Now we want to implement a better mechanism for sending and receiving messages, namely using JSON as the message format.
This is called implementing a JSON Message Converter, which eliminates the need to manually convert messages.
We send a message (DummyMessage) from the Producer.
This message is stored in JSON format (without manually converting it).
In the Consumer, the message is received and processed without any problems.
Here we have manually converted the message to JSON! But we want this to be done automatically.
(String jsonMessage = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(myMessage);)
ðŸ”¹ How do we solve this problem?
Using Jackson2JsonMessageConverter, which automatically converts our messages between JSON and Java Object.
